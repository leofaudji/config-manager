# --- FIX: Use the 'no-driver' variant for two-stage deployments ---
# This base image contains the Falco binary but does NOT have an entrypoint
# that tries to load a driver, which is perfect since we pre-load it with falco-driver-loader.

# --- FIX: Ensure the default falco.yaml is present in the final image ---
# This provides the necessary base configuration for scap to initialize correctly.
